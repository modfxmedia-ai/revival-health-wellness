const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Sculptra®?",
    answer:
      "Sculptra® is made from poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biocompatible compound that triggers collagen regeneration in the skin. It’s ideal for patients looking for subtle, long-lasting results without appearing overfilled or overdone.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Sculptra different from traditional dermal fillers?",
    answer:
      "Unlike traditional dermal fillers that provide immediate volume, Sculptra works gradually by stimulating your body’s own collagen production. The results build over time and look natural - lasting up to two years or more.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Sculptra for?",
    answer:
      "Sculptra is perfect for individuals experiencing age-related volume loss, facial hollowness, or those who want a more youthful contour without the immediacy or plumpness of HA fillers. It’s also great as part of a preventative anti-aging regimen.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do results last?",
    answer:
      "Results last up to 24 months with a proper treatment plan. Because Sculptra stimulates your own collagen, the improvement continues to build after each session and settles into a naturally refreshed appearance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I look “done”?",
    answer:
      "No. Sculptra isn’t about changing how you look - it’s about restoring what time has taken and enhancing your natural features with grace and longevity. Your provider will personalize your treatment plan to ensure results unfold gradually, keeping you looking refreshed - not “done.”",
