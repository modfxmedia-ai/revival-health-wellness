  {
    question: "What is finasteride?",
    answer:
      "Finasteride is an FDA-approved oral medication for hair loss. It’s shown to slow down hair loss in about 88% of men and help regrow hair in around 66%. With these success rates, it’s clear that this treatment has been highly effective for many people.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does finasteride work?",
    answer:
      "Finasteride works by blocking DHT, a hormone that contributes to hair loss. Instead of focusing on hair grafts or enlarging follicles, finasteride tackles the root cause by binding to an enzyme called 5α-Reductase and reducing the amount of DHT in your body.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Everyone responds differently to finasteride. For some people, it might take about four months of daily use before you start to see results, while for others, it could take six months or longer. During your consultation, we’ll talk about when you might begin to notice changes and explain the stages of hair growth so you know what to expect throughout the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any side effects?",
    answer:
      "A first check-up is important to find any possible unwanted reactions, seeing that finasteride can seriously impact some men negatively. We need to confirm that finasteride is safe and secure for you. During this consultation, we’ll review your past health records, discuss any potential side effects, and ensure you are fully aware of all the needed facts to make a smart decision about this therapy.",
