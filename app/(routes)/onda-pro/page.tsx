const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is ONDA Pro?",
    answer:
      "ONDA Pro is a non-invasive body-contouring device by DEKA that uses Coolwaves - a proprietary microwave technology - to selectively heat subcutaneous fat cells while protecting the surface of the skin. In the same treatment, the residual thermal action stimulates dermal remodeling for skin tightening and cellulite improvement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can ONDA Pro treat?",
    answer:
      "ONDA Pro is cleared for localized fat reduction, skin laxity, and cellulite - across the abdomen, flanks, thighs, buttocks, arms, and bra-line area. It’s particularly well-suited to patients seeking a non-surgical alternative to liposuction who also want a mild skin-tightening benefit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer:
      "Most patients see meaningful results after a series of 3–4 sessions spaced 2–4 weeks apart. Your provider will build a personalized protocol during your consultation based on your goals and the treatment area.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a session feel like?",
    answer:
      "Sessions are comfortable - you’ll feel a warm, massage-like sensation as the handpiece is moved across the treatment area. There’s no numbing required and no post-treatment soreness. Sessions typically run 20–40 minutes depending on the area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there downtime?",
    answer:
      "None. You may see mild pinkness in the treated area for a few hours, but you can return to work, exercise, and normal activities immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Initial changes are visible within a few weeks. Optimal results build gradually over 3–6 months as the body naturally metabolizes the treated fat cells and new collagen forms.",
  },
