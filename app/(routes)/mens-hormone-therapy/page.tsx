  {
    question: "What is testosterone therapy?",
    answer:
      "Testosterone therapy replaces the testosterone your body no longer produces in adequate amounts, using bio-identical hormones designed to be exact molecular copies of what your body naturally makes. The result is 100% natural, tailored, and highly effective care.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do bio-identical hormones work?",
    answer:
      "Bio-identical hormones are structurally identical to the ones your body produces, which makes them recognized and used just like the real thing. Our specialists design your plan, test regularly, and monitor results so we can adjust as your body responds.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is testosterone therapy administered?",
    answer:
      "We offer both injections and pellet implantation. Pellets are placed under the skin in the hip or buttock area and gradually release small amounts of testosterone directly into the bloodstream for consistent, effective hormone delivery.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I feel the difference?",
    answer:
      "Most men notice improved energy, focus, and drive within a few weeks. Muscle tone, recovery, and cardiovascular markers usually take 2–4 months to fully improve as your body stabilizes.",
