  {
    question: "What is Emsculpt NEO?",
    answer:
      "Emsculpt NEO is the first non-invasive body-shaping procedure that helps eliminate fat and build muscle simultaneously in a single 30-minute session. It combines Radiofrequency (RF) heating with High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic (HIFEM) energy to reduce fat cells while triggering intense muscle contractions. Clinical studies show an average 30% reduction in subcutaneous fat and 25% increase in muscle thickness.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate for Emsculpt NEO?",
    answer:
      "If you can benefit from less fat and more muscle, Emsculpt NEO may be a great fit for you. It has broad appeal because it can treat patients up to BMI 35 — a wider range than most body-contouring options. It’s especially popular for the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, arms, and calves.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Emsculpt NEO feel like?",
    answer:
      "You’ll feel intense muscle contractions and a heating sensation in the treated area — comparable to a hot stone massage combined with an intense workout. Some patients experience mild soreness afterward, similar to post-workout muscle fatigue. This typically resolves within a few days.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",
    answer:
      "Many patients notice tangible results immediately after the first few sessions. Optimal results are typically observed 90 days after the final session and can continue improving for several weeks as your body responds to the treatment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Emsculpt NEO different from the original Emsculpt?",
    answer:
      "The original Emsculpt uses HIFEM alone to build muscle. Emsculpt NEO adds Radiofrequency heating simultaneously, which allows it to reduce fat AND build muscle in the same session. It’s also FDA-cleared for a wider range of treatment areas including thighs, calves, arms, glutes, and abdomen.",
