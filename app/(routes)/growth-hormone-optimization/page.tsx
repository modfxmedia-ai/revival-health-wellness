    question: "What is growth hormone deficiency?",
    answer:
      "Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and helps regulate body composition, fluids, muscle and bone growth, and mental function. A deficiency means your pituitary isn't producing enough to meet your body's needs.",

  {
    question: "What causes growth hormone deficiency in adults?",
    answer:
      "Common causes include under-active hypothalamic drive, damage to the pituitary or hypothalamus, tumors in either area, or surgery or radiation to remove a tumor. A short workup helps identify the underlying cause.",

      "At Revival we carefully determine the appropriate dosage tailored to your needs. The treatment is administered via injections directly into the fat tissue beneath the skin.",
