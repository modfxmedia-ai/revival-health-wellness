  {
    question: "What is Dysport?",
    answer:
      "Dysport is an FDA-approved injectable that temporarily relaxes targeted facial muscles to reduce the appearance of dynamic wrinkles — those lines formed by repeated facial expressions such as frowning, squinting, and smiling. It’s especially effective for frown lines (the “11s” between your brows), forehead creases, crow’s feet, and bunny lines on the nose.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly does Dysport work?",
    answer:
      "Dysport offers faster results than some other neurotoxins, with most patients seeing noticeable smoothing in as little as 2–3 days, and results lasting up to 4 months.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Dysport different from Botox?",
    answer:
      "Both are FDA-approved neurotoxins that relax targeted facial muscles to soften dynamic wrinkles. Dysport tends to spread slightly more across a treated area, which can be ideal for larger zones like the forehead, and often takes effect a little faster than Botox.",
  },
  {
    question: "What other Galderma treatments do you offer?",
    answer:
      "At Revival Health and Wellness, we proudly offer the full suite of Galderma’s premium aesthetic treatments — crafted to refine, restore, and enhance your natural beauty. From the smooth, expressive results of Dysport® to the contouring precision of the Restylane® dermal filler family, each product in the Galderma portfolio is backed by science and designed with elegance in mind.",
