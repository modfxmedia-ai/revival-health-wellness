  {
    question: "What is microneedling?",
    answer:
      "Microneedling is one of the most popular and effective skincare treatments available today. It gets its name from the tiny, fine needles used to create micro-injuries in the skin, which trigger the body’s natural healing process. This process not only rejuvenates the skin but also stimulates the production of new collagen — leading to smoother, firmer, healthier-looking skin.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during a microneedling appointment?",
    answer:
      "Your face is thoroughly cleansed and a topical anesthetic is applied to minimize discomfort (30–60 minutes to take full effect). Once numb, a derma-roller or microneedling machine gently passes over the skin, creating tiny punctures. The microneedling process itself takes about 15 minutes for the face. After treatment, a cooling mask is applied for about half an hour, followed by topical skincare products or serum to enhance results.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does microneedling work?",
    answer:
      "The tiny needles create micro-injuries in the skin, which activate the body’s natural wound repair process. This stimulates the production of both collagen and elastin, leading to significantly improved and more radiant skin. Microneedling addresses various skin concerns and boosts collagen production, making it effective for both anti-aging and skin repair.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the downtime after microneedling?",
    answer:
      "Downtime is minimal, but you should expect noticeable redness after your appointment — similar to a mild sunburn. It’s advisable not to plan on returning to work or going anywhere for the rest of the day. Applying a moisturizer with ceramide can help keep your skin hydrated. Avoid sun exposure, exfoliating products, alcohol-based toners, and the gym/sauna/hot tub for at least 24 hours. By the next day your skin should return to normal color, and by day three you’ll notice more radiance and glow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can microneedling be combined with other treatments?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many patients opt to combine microneedling with serums or other topicals during treatment. Incorporating elements like vitamins, Botox®, or even platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can enhance the results of your microneedling session. Ask us about the options available to further boost your treatment outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer:
      "For the best outcomes, multiple treatments are usually recommended. Your provider will design a plan based on your specific skin concerns and goals during your consultation.",
