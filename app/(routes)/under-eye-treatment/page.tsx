    text: "Your appointment begins with a consultation to confirm EZ Gel is right for you. A small blood sample is collected and processed into your personalized EZ Gel, which your provider then carefully injects into the under-eye area using techniques designed for comfort and precision. The full visit typically takes 60–90 minutes.",

    title: "Recovery",

  {
    title: "Results",
    text: "Some improvement is visible as initial swelling resolves, but the true benefits build gradually over weeks and months as collagen remodels. For optimal rejuvenation we often recommend a series of 2–3 treatments, spaced 8–12 weeks apart.",

const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is under-eye / tear trough treatment?",
    answer:
      "The tear trough is the delicate hollow between the lower eyelid and the cheekbone. Age, genetics, and volume loss can create shadows, hollows, and “tired” looking eyes. Under-eye treatment brightens dark circles, smooths crepey texture, and restores gentle volume for a well-rested, youthful appearance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does tear trough lightening work?",
    answer:
      "Small amounts of hyaluronic acid filler are precisely placed in the tear trough to gently restore volume, reflect light differently, and smooth the transition between the lower lid and the cheek. Our injectors also often pair this with skin brightening or PRP protocols depending on your concerns.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do results last?",
    answer:
      "Most patients enjoy results lasting 9 to 18 months, depending on the product used and your metabolism. We’ll create a maintenance plan that keeps you looking refreshed year-round.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any downtime?",
    answer:
      "Downtime is minimal. Some patients experience mild swelling, redness, or bruising at the injection sites, but most return to daily activities right away. Avoid strenuous exercise and heat exposure for 24 hours after treatment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I a good candidate?",
    answer:
      "The best candidates have hollows or dark circles in the tear trough area, are in generally good health, are over 18, are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and have realistic expectations. A consultation confirms whether tear-trough treatment is the right approach for you.",
