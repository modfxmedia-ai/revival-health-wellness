    question: "What is Phentermine?",
    answer:
      "Phentermine is an FDA-approved prescription weight-loss medication used for long-term weight management, often in combination with topiramate. It's a remarkably safe, non-addictive medication that has been trusted for over 50 years and is prescribed in three-month cycles.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Phentermine work?",
    answer:
      "Phentermine targets your brain and nervous system, releasing dopamine and norepinephrine to stimulate metabolism and suppress hunger. It also triggers adrenaline and epinephrine outside the brain - hormones with powerful fat-burning properties. Taken once daily in the morning, it peaks in 3–5 hours and continues supporting weight loss throughout the day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Phentermine right for me?",
    answer:
      "Phentermine is typically prescribed for adults with a BMI greater than 25. Our specialists review your medical history and perform a physical exam during your consultation, then tailor your dose to your needs. Many patients also take Topiramate alongside Phentermine to enhance the effectiveness of the plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who should not take Phentermine?",
    answer:
      "Phentermine is not suitable for individuals with coronary heart disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or a history of drug abuse. During your consultation we'll confirm it's safe for you before writing a prescription.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will Phentermine give me side effects?",
    answer:
      "Phentermine acts partially as a stimulant, so monitoring blood pressure is important. Common side effects include dry mouth, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, temporary diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and nervousness. Our team monitors you throughout the program and adjusts dose or timing to minimize side effects.",
