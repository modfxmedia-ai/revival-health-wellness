  {
    question: "What is Botox and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Botox works by temporarily blocking the nerve signals that cause facial muscles to contract when we make expressions. This relaxation of the muscles leads to a significant reduction in the visibility of wrinkles. While the muscles are temporarily “frozen,” you’ll still be able to make natural facial expressions, provided you choose a skilled and experienced provider to administer the injections.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a Botox treatment take?",
    answer:
      "A typical Botox treatment takes about 15 minutes and requires no downtime, making it a convenient option for many. To ensure the best results, we will ask you to stop taking any blood thinners a week before your appointment. On the day of your treatment, we will cleanse your face and, if necessary, apply a topical numbing cream for your comfort. One of our licensed medical professionals will then administer the Botox using a very small needle. These injections will be carefully placed in the precise areas needed to address your specific concerns and achieve optimal results.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results and how long do they last?",
    answer:
      "You can expect to start seeing the effects of Botox about three days after your appointment. The duration of Botox results can vary depending on factors like muscle strength and the depth of your lines and wrinkles. On average, Botox results last between 3 to 5 months. For optimal results, we recommend scheduling Botox treatments every 3 to 4 months.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I avoid after my Botox treatment?",
    answer:
      "After your Botox treatment, some patients may experience minimal bruising, tenderness, or swelling at the injection site, but these effects typically subside quickly. In the week following your treatment, it’s important to avoid rubbing your face, sleeping on your face, high-intensity exercise, tanning, bending over, saunas, and hot water. You should also be cautious when applying makeup.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I a good candidate for Botox?",
    answer:
      "Botox is one of our most requested treatments, and during your consultation, we can discuss how it can effectively improve the areas that concern you. The best candidates want to reduce lines, creases, and wrinkles on the face and neck; are over 18; do not have an allergy to Botox; are not pregnant or breastfeeding; are free of skin infections; and do not have a neurological condition.",
