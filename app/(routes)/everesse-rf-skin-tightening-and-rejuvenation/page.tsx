    question: "Do the treatments hurt?",

  {
    question: "How many sessions do I need?",
    answer:
      "Many patients see excellent results after a single CoolPeel or Radiant Lift session. Everesse typically requires 1–3 treatments spaced 4–6 weeks apart for optimal lifting and tightening. Your personalized treatment plan will be outlined during your consultation based on your specific goals.",

    question: "When will I see results?",

    answer:
      "Results from both treatments can last 6–18 months or longer, depending on your age, skin condition, lifestyle factors, and maintenance routine. Many patients return for touch-up treatments once or twice yearly to maintain their results.",
