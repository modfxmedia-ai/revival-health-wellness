    question: "What is hormone replacement therapy (HRT)?",
    answer:
      "HRT reintroduces hormones your body no longer produces in adequate amounts, using one hormone or a combination tailored to your chemistry. The goal is to relieve age-related symptoms and restore energy, mood, and vitality.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is hormone therapy administered?",
    answer:
      "Depending on your plan we may use bio-identical hormone pellets inserted in the hip or buttock, testosterone injections, topical creams, or oral options. Pellets release small, steady doses directly into the bloodstream over several months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is hormone therapy right for me?",
    answer:
      "If you're experiencing low energy, weight changes, mood swings, poor sleep, decreased libido, or menopause-related symptoms, HRT may help. We start with lab work and a consultation to confirm you're a good candidate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I see results?",
    answer:
      "Most patients begin noticing improvements in energy, sleep, and mood within 2–4 weeks. Full results typically emerge over 3–6 months as your body stabilizes on the protocol.",
