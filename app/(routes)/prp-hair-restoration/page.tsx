  {
    question: "What is PRP hair restoration?",
    answer:
      "PRP (platelet-rich plasma) hair restoration is a treatment that leverages your body’s own plasma to stimulate new hair growth. Plasma, found within your blood, contains platelets, which in turn house growth factors responsible for cell growth and tissue repair. Through a series of PRP hair injections, these growth factors can assist men and women with specific hair conditions — particularly androgenetic alopecia — in restoring hair growth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does PRP hair restoration work?",
    answer:
      "Platelets act like our body’s natural first responders. When we get a cut or wound, platelets rush to the site to stop the bleeding and promote quick healing. This same “rescue team” can be used to awaken dormant hair follicles and stimulate new hair growth by encouraging inactive follicles to enter an active growth phase. A small amount of blood is drawn, spun in a centrifuge to separate red blood cells from plasma, and the plasma — rich with platelets and growth factors — is injected into the scalp.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during a PRP appointment?",
    answer:
      "Your first PRP session starts with cleaning the scalp and applying topical anesthetics to decrease discomfort. Blood is drawn from a vein, spun in a centrifuge to separate the plasma, then the plasma is drawn into a syringe and injected into specific areas of your scalp. Most people find the injections quite tolerable thanks to the anesthetic. The entire process typically takes about one and a half hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is recovery like?",
    answer:
      "PRP hair injections allow you to resume your regular daily activities immediately after your appointment. However, some patients may experience minor side effects such as soreness, swelling, itching, or pinpoint bleeding at the injection sites. These effects are typically mild and subside quickly.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer:
      "PRP hair injections are not a quick fix. Hair regrowth takes time, and many people need several sessions to achieve and maintain their desired results. Since hair loss can be caused by various factors like stress, genetics, age, medications, or illness, results can vary based on the underlying cause.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is a good candidate?",
    answer:
      "You might be a great candidate for PRP hair restoration if you’re in good health, are experiencing hair loss (especially from androgenetic alopecia), and understand that seeing results is a gradual process.",
