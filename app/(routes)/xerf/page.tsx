const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is Xerf?",
    answer:
      "Xerf is a non-invasive skin tightening, lifting, and rejuvenation platform used on both the face and body. It stimulates the skin’s own collagen and elastin production to firm, lift, and smooth over time - without incisions, injections, or downtime.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can Xerf treat?",
    answer:
      "Xerf is used for skin laxity and early signs of aging - including a soft jawline, neck crepiness, loose skin on the abdomen or arms, and general loss of firmness. It’s also used to maintain results between more intensive treatments.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer:
      "Most patients see meaningful improvement after a series of 3–6 sessions. Your provider will design a personalized protocol during your consultation based on the treatment area and your goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Xerf hurt?",
    answer:
      "No. Sessions are comfortable - patients typically describe a warm, relaxing sensation. No numbing cream is required and there’s no post-treatment soreness.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any downtime?",
    answer:
      "None. Xerf is a lunch-break treatment - you can return to work, exercise, and normal skincare immediately afterward.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Some patients notice initial tightening right after their first session, but the real transformation builds gradually over 8–12 weeks as collagen and elastin remodel in the treated area.",
  },
