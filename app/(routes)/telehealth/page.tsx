  {
    question: "What is telehealth?",
    answer:
      "Telehealth is a secure video visit with a licensed Revival provider. You get the same personalized care you'd receive in-clinic, just from the comfort of home.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which services can I do virtually?",
    answer:
      "Weight-loss consultations, hormone therapy reviews, sexual wellness consultations, medication adjustments, and follow-up visits are all available online.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I be prescribed medication over telehealth?",
    answer:
      "Yes-when clinically appropriate and after a proper evaluation. Some prescriptions require baseline labs, which we order from a lab near you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept insurance for telehealth?",
    answer:
      "Revival is a cash-pay concierge clinic. We provide superbills you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my visit private?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. All video visits use HIPAA-compliant secure video, and your records are protected under the same privacy standards as an in-clinic visit.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need an in-person exam?",
    answer:
      "We'll always tell you when a treatment requires an in-clinic visit. Booking a virtual visit is often the fastest path to figuring out the right next step.",
