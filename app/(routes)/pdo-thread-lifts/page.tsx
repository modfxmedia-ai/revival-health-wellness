const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is a PDO thread lift?",
    answer:
      "A PDO thread lift is a minimally invasive, non-surgical procedure that lifts and tightens sagging skin using dissolvable polydioxanone (PDO) threads. The threads are placed beneath the skin to provide an immediate lifting effect while stimulating new collagen and elastin production over the following months.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas can be treated?",
    answer:
      "PDO thread lifts can effectively improve the mid-face and cheeks, jawline definition, jowls, neck laxity, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and marionette lines. Your provider will customize the placement based on your anatomy and goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the procedure take?",
    answer:
      "Most PDO thread lift appointments take 45–90 minutes depending on the number of areas being treated. This includes consultation, cleansing, local anesthesia, and precise thread placement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is recovery like?",
    answer:
      "Most patients return to normal daily activities within a few days. You may experience mild swelling, bruising, tenderness, or a feeling of tightness for several days. Your provider will review detailed aftercare instructions to help optimize healing and your final results.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results last?",
    answer:
      "Many patients notice an immediate lifting effect right after treatment. As collagen production increases over the next 2–3 months, the skin continues to become firmer, smoother, and more youthful. Results typically last 12–18 months, though longevity varies based on age, skin quality, lifestyle, and the treatment area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I a good candidate?",
    answer:
      "PDO thread lifts are ideal for individuals with mild to moderate skin laxity who want noticeable lifting without surgery. Great candidates are looking to lift sagging cheeks or jowls, improve jawline definition, tighten loose neck skin, elevate the brows, stimulate natural collagen production, and achieve natural-looking rejuvenation with minimal downtime.",
