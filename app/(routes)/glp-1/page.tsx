  {
    question: "What is GLP-1?",
    answer:
      "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a hormone your body naturally produces after eating. GLP-1 medications mimic that signal to help regulate appetite, slow digestion, and support healthier blood sugar-so weight loss becomes more sustainable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does GLP-1 help with weight loss?",
    answer:
      "By reducing hunger, extending satiety after meals, and improving how your body responds to food, GLP-1 makes it easier to eat in a moderate calorie deficit without willpower alone doing all the work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does compounded GLP-1 medication actually help you lose weight?",
    answer:
      "Yes-when it's part of a medically supervised plan. At Revival we combine compounded GLP-1 with lab work, dose titration, nutrition guidance, and weekly progress tracking so results are real and lasting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can benefit from GLP-1 medication?",
    answer:
      "Adults with a BMI of 30+ (or 27+ with weight-related conditions), those who have struggled with diet-and-exercise-only approaches, and anyone looking for an appetite-focused, non-stimulant option under medical supervision.",
