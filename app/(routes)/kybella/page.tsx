  {
    question: "What is Kybella®?",
    answer:
      "FDA-approved since 2015, Kybella® is revolutionary in its ability to target and eliminate fat beneath the chin. Prior to Kybella, the only effective way to treat a double chin was through liposuction. The convenience of an injectable, non-surgical treatment for removing excess submental fat has made Kybella a highly sought-after option.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Kybella work?",
    answer:
      "Kybella’s active ingredient is a synthetic form of deoxycholic acid, a molecule naturally found in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. When injected directly into the excess fat beneath the chin, Kybella destroys the fat cells in the targeted area, preventing them from storing fat again.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during a Kybella appointment?",
    answer:
      "When you arrive we’ll start with “before” photos, apply a numbing cream, then place a temporary tattoo dot grid to guide the injections. You can expect 10 to 50 injections that take only a few minutes. Some patients feel a slight burning sensation - we provide ice packs to alleviate this. After the session, we’ll wrap your chin with a compression bandage, and you may experience mild soreness.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many treatments will I need?",
    answer:
      "For optimal results, Kybella typically requires 2 to 4 treatments spaced 4–6 weeks apart. Most patients begin to notice changes after 2 to 3 sessions. The exact number depends on the amount of fat being treated. Once you’re satisfied, no further maintenance treatments are necessary - the destroyed fat cells are gone for good.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is recovery like?",
    answer:
      "After Kybella, most patients notice some swelling, which can make it seem like your double chin is getting bigger - rest assured, that’s just part of the process. Swelling usually peaks around 24 hours after your first treatment and can last a few days to a few weeks. You may also experience some bruising, a burning sensation, or numbness in the treated area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I a good candidate?",
    answer:
      "The ideal candidate is at least 18 years old, has a moderate double chin, has good skin quality with minimal laxity, is not obese, understands that Kybella is not intended for weight loss, and has realistic expectations about the results.",
