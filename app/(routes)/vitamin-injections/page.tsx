  {
    question: "What is a vitamin booster injection?",
    answer:
      "A vitamin booster is a small intramuscular injection of concentrated vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Because it bypasses the digestive system, absorption is much higher than with oral supplements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often can I get one?",
    answer:
      "Most patients benefit from weekly or biweekly injections during their program, then move to monthly maintenance. We'll match the cadence to your goals during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which injection is right for me?",
    answer:
      "It depends on what you're solving for—energy, immunity, weight-loss support, recovery, or skin brightness. We recommend a specific booster (or combination) based on your labs and goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do they hurt?",
    answer:
      "Vitamin injections are quick and generally well tolerated. You may feel a small pinch, similar to a routine vaccination, and can return to normal activity immediately.",
  },
