    question: "What is women's hormone therapy?",
    answer:
      "It's a personalized plan that replaces the hormones—primarily estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone—your body no longer produces in adequate amounts. The goal is to restore your natural balance and relieve menopause and perimenopause symptoms.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is women's hormone therapy administered?",
    answer:
      "Most of our patients use bio-identical hormone pellets inserted under the skin in the hip or buttock area. The pellets release small, steady amounts of hormone directly into the bloodstream over several months, closely mimicking natural production.",
  },
  {
    question: "Am I a candidate for HRT?",
    answer:
      "If you're experiencing insomnia, mood swings, fatigue, weight changes, low libido, or menopause symptoms, a custom bio-identical program may be ideal. A short lab panel and consultation confirms whether HRT is right for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do bio-identical hormone pellets work?",
    answer:
      "Bio-identical pellets are exact molecular copies of the hormones your body makes. They fully dissolve and absorb, releasing hormone steadily over 3–4 months without daily creams, pills, or injections.",
  },
